# Ovarro Software Engineer Technical Test

## Brief

Create an application to model a game of [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). Feel free to use a framework if you wish. The application must fulfil the following core requirements:
* Initialise a new game grid.
* Add a token to the game grid. A token can be either Red or Yellow. A token is added to a specified grid column.
* Show the game grid state.
* Show the next player to play, Red or Yellow.
* Show the winner.
* These operations should be exposed through a REST API.

As much as possible, please keep it simple. If you need any further information, please ask. We would rather you asked obvious questions and got it right rather than not ask questions and get it wrong. (Asking good questions is seen as a positive!)

## Review Criteria

All tech test submissions (for any of our tech tests) are anonymised and reviewed using a standard template.

At a high level we will be looking for:
* Readability: clear naming conventions, clear documentation where necessary
* Good understanding of the programming language and its features
* Automated tests
* Simplicity
* Clear instructions on how to build, test & run the application using the build framework of your choice
* Logging
* Error handling
* Clearly described regular commits visible through VCS

## Languages

We use a mixture of languages but the majority of our codebase is Java. For this tech test we recommend you use Java, but if you can show off your skills better in another language then please do so and include your justification in the README.

## Timescale

Please time-box this exercise at about 3 hours. If you've spent more than that and you're still not finished, just submit what you have - we're more interested in what you have done, not what you haven't, nor do we want this to take up a huge amount of your time. It is more important to model a subset of functionality to a higher level of quality than to model all the functionality but to a lower level of quality.

## The Deliverable

In the root of your application create a README.md including:

  1. A covering note explaining the technology choices you have made.
  2. Any instructions required to run your solution and tests in a Linux/Mac environment.

Email a link to your repo (make sure it's public!), or as an attachment the git bundled repository showing your commit history with all your commits on the master branch:

        git bundle create <anything>.bundle --all
